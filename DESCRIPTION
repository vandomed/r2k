Description: For example, table_r2k(x, y) is like table(x, y) but produces a 
    kable output that prints neatly to the RStudio Viewer or to an R Markdown 
    document. Other functions include lm_r2k, glm_r2k, gee_r2k, coxph_r2k, 
    and svyglm_r2k. Also includes a generic r2k function for converting R 
    objects to kables.

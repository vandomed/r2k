```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>", 
  message = FALSE, 
  fig.width = 3
)

# Load packages
library("r2k")
library("knitr")

# Set xtable options
options("xtable.caption.placement" = "top", 
        "xtable.include.rownames" = TRUE, 
        "xtable.comment" = FALSE)
```


## Installation

You can install and load **r2k** from GitHub via the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("vandomed/r2k")
library("r2k")
```


## Concept

The idea is to provide functions that work just like a common base R function, like `table` and `glm`, but that immediately produce neat `kable` outputs. For example, you can call `table_r2k` just as you would `table`, but the result will be a `kable` that is immediately printed to the RStudio Viewer, and which is immediately ready for printing in an R Markdown document.


## Functions

### table_r2k

Here's an example:

To summarize a fitted generalized linear model, simply call `glm_v` as you would `glm`. The result will be a formatted summary table printed to the RStudio Viewer. Here's an example for logistic regression:

```{r eval = FALSE}
table_r2k(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("table_r2k.PNG")
```

From here, you can "snip" the table and save it as a figure (as I did for this README) or copy directly from the Viewer and paste outside of R.

Alternatively, you can call `table_r2k` within an R Markdown document, and the resulting table should print very nicely without any extra steps.
